The problem that we were trying to solve was to create an online store, with a focus on sports equipment.

There aren't really any instructions for the user interface, other than changing the role is done through a link and not mongoDB (for now).

Libraries used:
pymongo
flask
uuid (ended up not being used)

There are no extra features implemented beyond the barebones, there was no time for it.

The separation of work should have been that I would create the base application (setting up the flask server and connecting to MongoDB) and inventory management, and Narandan would work on the shopping cart and role based access through MongoDB. However, as of June 19, 2024 at 7:16 PM, I have created everything in the GitHub, and I have not heard from Narandan since last night.
